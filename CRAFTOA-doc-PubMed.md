PubMed is a free resource supporting the search and retrieval of biomedical and life sciences literature with the aim of improving healthâ€“both globally and personally. The PubMed database contains more than 37 million citations and abstracts of biomedical literature. It does not include full text journal articles; however, links to the full text are often present when available from other sources, such as the publisher's website or PubMed Central (PMC).
