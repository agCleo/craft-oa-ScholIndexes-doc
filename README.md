# Documentation about Academic Publications Indexes

    !!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

## About 
This repository contains the documentation catalogue about indexes for academic publications. It is meant to help publishers understand and select the appropriate index or aggregator for their publications, as well as the requirements they will have to meet.
   
The catalogue has been established within the [CRAFT-OA](https://www.craft-oa.eu/) Horizon Europe project, as part of the WP5 lead by [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/). 

CRAFT-OA is an [OPERAS RI](https://operas-eu.org/) project coordinated by the [University of Göttigen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) and it aims at supporting the publishers and authors following the Diamond Open Access model. This catalogue is one aspect of such support.

CRAFT-OA was funded in 2022 under the HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01 framework with the Grant Agreement number 101094397.

## What contains the catalog?
The catalog contains detailed, although not exhaustive, information about the main indexes in the field of academic publishing.  

In order to facilitate the broadest dissemination of Diamond Open Access journals, the catalogue includes any type of index that might be useful for that purpose.

The term "index" was chosen as the broader term and can therefore correspond to a variety of types: repositories, aggregators, thematic indexes, etc. The documentation should help to identify and understand these differences.

## How to read the catalogue?
Each index correspond to one specific file.

Each index is described using the same structure:
- Introduction
- General information
- Content and service
- Requirements
    - Joigning process
    - Minimum requirements
    - Additional criteria
 
The first section “General Information” gives a concise view of the global aspects of the index. It concerns administration and typology aspects of the index.

The second section “Content and Service” explains which and how journal's information is displayed on the index. It describes the data selection and management. It also indicates, when available, some additional services of the index besides the indexing.

The third and final section “Requirements for Academic Publications” exposes the requirements and criteria of the index. While some criteria will require a deeper look into the index own documentation, the catalogue intends to give sufficient information to evaluate the feasibility for a given journal to meet the requirements.

## How up-to-date is the catalogue?
Besides the automated version history integrated in Github, each catalogue entry indicates the date of the last version.

Furthermore, it was since the beginning the plan of CRAFT-OA to provide an easily updatable and scalable documentation about academic publications indexes. The independent files for each index, as well as the consistent and robust structure of each entry will precisely facilitate the collaborative updates. The storage on a github will in addition allow to keep track of all the changes.

## Are there other versions of the catalog?

PDF: not yet, but soon.

Gitbook: not yet, but maybe.
