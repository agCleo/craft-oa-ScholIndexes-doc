# Guide to Scholarly Indexes

## About 
This repository contains the Guide to Scholarly Indexes, a catalog of synthetic documentations about indexes for scholarly publications. It is meant to help publishers selecting the appropriate index or aggregator for their publications, as well as understanding the requirements they will have to meet.

The Guide has been established within the [CRAFT-OA](https://www.craft-oa.eu/) Horizon Europe project, a building project of the [European Diamond Capacity Hub](https://diamas.org/).

The European Diamond Capacity Hub (EDCH) and the CRAFT-OA project aim at supporting the publishers and authors following the [Diamond Open Access model](https://diamas.org/diamond-open-access). The Guide to Scholarly Indexes is one aspect of such support.   

## What contains the Guide?
The Guide contains detailed, although not exhaustive, information about the main indexes referencing academic publications. 

The indexes listed here correspond to the indexes either most used by any type of publisher, or most useful for Diamond Open Access journals, in order to facilitate broader dissemination. Given their increasing importance in various aggregation processes, PIDs registration agencies were also listed, be it only as an important piece of information.

The term "index" was chosen as the broader term and can therefore correspond to a variety of service types: repositories, aggregators, thematic indexes, etc. The documentation should help to identify and understand these differences. For the purpose of this catalog, the project team established the following typology:
- Automated aggregator with submission (such as BASE, GoTriple, OpenAIRE)
- Fully automated aggregator (such as CORE, Gscholar, OpenAlex, Semantic scholar)
- PIDs Registration agency (such as Crossref, Datacite)
- Selective bibliographic and bibliometric indexes (such as Scopus, Web Of Science)
- Selective bibliographic index and full text repository (such as CEEOL)
- Selective bibliographic index (such as DOAJ, Ebsco, ERIH PLUS, Pubmed)

## How to read the Guide?
Each index documentation corresponds to one specific file.

Each index documentation follows the same structure:
- Introduction
- Service Description
- Service Provision
- Inclusion process
- Minimum Requirements
- Additional Criteria
- Information Sources
 
The first two sections "Introduction" and "Service Description" give a concise view of the global aspects of the index. It concerns administration and typology aspects.

The second section “Service Provision” explains which and how journal's information is displayed on the index. It describes the data selection and management. It also indicates, when available, some additional services of the index besides the indexing.

The sections “Inclusion process”, "Minimum Requirements" and "Additional Criteria" expose the requirements and selection criteria of the index. While some criteria will require a deeper look into the index own documentation, the Guide intends to give sufficient information to evaluate the feasibility for a given journal to meet the requirements.

The last section "Information Sources" gives links to the main sources of information used to build the documentation.
