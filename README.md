# Catalog of documentations about Scholarly Publications Indexes

## About 
This repository contains the documentations catalog about indexes for scholarly publications. It is meant to help publishers understand and select the appropriate index or aggregator for their publications, as well as the requirements they will have to meet.
   
The catalog has been established within the [CRAFT-OA](https://www.craft-oa.eu/) Horizon Europe project, as part of the WP5 lead by [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/). 

CRAFT-OA is an [OPERAS RI](https://operas-eu.org/) project coordinated by the [University of Göttigen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) and it aims at supporting the publishers and authors following the Diamond Open Access model. This catalog is one aspect of such support.

CRAFT-OA was funded in 2022 under the HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01 framework with the Grant Agreement number 101094397.

## What contains the catalog?
The catalog contains detailed, although not exhaustive, information about the main indexes in the field of academic publishing. 

The indexes listed here correspond to the indexes either most used generally, or most useful for Diamond Open Access journals, in order to facilitate their broadest dissemination. Given their increasing importance in various aggregation processes, PIDs registration agencies were also listed, be it only as an important piece of information.

The term "index" was chosen as the broader term and can therefore correspond to a variety of types: repositories, aggregators, thematic indexes, etc. The documentation should help to identify and understand these differences. For the purpose of this catalog, the project team established the following typology:
- Automated aggregator with submission (such as BASE, GoTriple, OpenAIRE)
- Fully automated aggregator (such as CORE, Gscholar, OpenAlex, Semantic scholar)
- PIDs Registration agency (such as Crossref, Datacite)
- Selective bibliographic and bibliometric indexes (such as Scopus, Web Of Science)
- Selective bibliographic index and full text repository (such as CEEOL)
- Selective bibliographic index (such as DOAJ, Ebsco, ERIH PLUS, Pubmed)

## How to read the catalogue?
Each index documentation corresponds to one specific file.

Each index documentation follows the same structure:
- Introduction
- General information
- Content and service
- Requirements
    - Joigning process
    - Minimum requirements
    - Additional criteria
 
The first section “General Information” gives a concise view of the global aspects of the index. It concerns administration and typology aspects of the index.

The second section “Content and Service” explains which and how journal's information is displayed on the index. It describes the data selection and management. It also indicates, when available, some additional services of the index besides the indexing.

The third and final section “Requirements for Academic Publications” exposes the requirements and selection criteria of the index. While some criteria will require a deeper look into the index own documentation, the catalog intends to give sufficient information to evaluate the feasibility for a given journal to meet the requirements.

## How up-to-date is the catalogue?
Besides the automated version history integrated in Github, each catalog entry indicates the date of the last version.

Furthermore, it was since the beginning the plan of CRAFT-OA to provide an easily updatable and scalable documentation about scholarly publications indexes. The independent files for each index, as well as the consistent and robust structure of each entry will precisely facilitate the collaborative updates. The storage on a github repository will in addition allow to keep track of all the changes.

## Are there other versions of the catalog?

Spreasheet: not yet, but soon.
