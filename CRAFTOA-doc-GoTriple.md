## Requirements for Academic Publications

### Joining Process

If the publications are not already stored in GoTriple’s data sources, the main option is to register a new data source through the dedicated interface: [https://pipeline.gotriple.eu/user/login?destination=/](https://pipeline.gotriple.eu/user/login?destination=/). 

**Data Collection process**

In order to be referenced on GoTriple it is necessary to provide a standard access to standard metadata, i.e. providing an [OAI-PMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open\_Archives\_Initiative\_Protocol\_for\_Metadata\_Harvesting) repository with metadata in the standards supported by GoTriple.   
It is also possible to send a file formatted according to the [OpenAIRE format](https://openaire-guidelines-for-literature-repository-managers.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/).
