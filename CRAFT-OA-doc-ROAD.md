# ROAD

ROAD provides a free access to those ISSN bibliographic records which describe scholarly resources in Open Access: journals, monographic series, conference proceedings, academic repositories and scholarly blogs. These records, created by the ISSN Network (93 National Centres worldwide + the International Centre), are enriched by information extracted from indexing and abstracting databases, directories (e.g. DOAJ, Latindex, The Keepers registry) and journals indicators (e.g. Scopus). ROAD only accepts journals with an ISSN.
